### <font color="cyan">When and how can I delete my data? </font>

-   As a server owner, collected data is only retained as long as the bot is on the server. If the bot is removed from the server, all stored data is deleted from the server. User-related, all data will be deleted if the user is out of reach of our bot, i.e. the user does not share a server with the bot.
